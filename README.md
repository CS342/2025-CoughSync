This repository contains the CoughSync application.
CoughSync is using the [Spezi](https://github.com/StanfordSpezi/Spezi) ecosystem and builds on top of the [Stanford Spezi Template Application](https://github.com/StanfordSpezi/SpeziTemplateApplication).

> [!TIP]
> Do you want to test the CoughSync application on your device? [You can downloard it on TestFlight](https://testflight.apple.com/join/2DKsMx2z).


## CoughSync Features

CoughSync is an application designed to track nighttime coughs. It utilizes a self-trained machine learning model to classify coughs from user-recorded audio. Users are encouraged to start audio tracking before bed, keeping their phone bedside while recording.

The app provides real-time cough counting and presents detailed data analysis, including trends in cough frequency (daily, weekly, and monthly), changes over time, and charts showing when coughs occur throughout the night.

To assess the impact of coughing on quality of life, users complete a weekly questionnaire. Additionally, the app can generate a comprehensive report of cough data, which can be used for personal insights or shared with a physician for further evaluation.

By collecting this novel data, CoughSync offers valuable insights to medical practitioners, enhancing the understanding of cough patterns and their role in diagnosis and treatment.
